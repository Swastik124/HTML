    <H1>Manipur Abouts</H1>
    <br>
    <p>Manipur is a state in northeast India, bordering Myanmar to its east and south. It consists of the Imphal Valley, associated with the Manipur kingdom, and the surrounding hills populated by hill tribes. The Imphal Valley constitutes about 10% of the geographical area of the state with 57% of the population,predominantly Meitei, who are majority Hindus, with minorities of Muslims and native Sanamahism followers. The surrounding hills constitute 90% of the geographical area of the state with 43% of the population belonging to 34 tribal groups broadly categorized as Nagas and Kukis. The Nagas dominate the northern districts while the Kukis are predominant in the south. The tribal people have the Scheduled Tribe (ST) status, whereas the Meitei have been accorded Other Backward Class (OBC) status, with some classified as Scheduled Castes (SC) in certain areas.

        The hill regions are noted by scholars as forming part of Zomia inhabited by "non-state" peoples. They came to be administered only after the Kuki rebellion of 1917-19, by British administrators without the involvement of the Meitei state. After Indian independence, the hill tribes continued to enjoy a protected status.The Manipur and Land Revenue and Land Reforms Act, 1960 prohibits transfer of tribal land to non-tribals except by special permission, thereby preventing Meitei and other people from expanding into the hill districts. The valley-based Meitei domiate the political establisment. Of the 60 Assembly constituencies, 40 are held by the valley and 20 by hill tribes.The tribal population is not prohibited from settling in the valley region.. Kukis state that they do not want to come to the valley but they have to since there are no roads no schools or hospitals in the hills.
        
        Tribal groups have complained that the government spending is unduly concentrated in the Meitei-dominated Imphal Valley.</p>
